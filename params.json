To send out bills we need to be able to read the meters installed at all households in a fast and easy manner.\r\n\r\nBefore we used pen and paper and sampled only once a year but now every household can sample their meter and report back to the central with fresh and more frequent samples.\r\n\r\nWe can also use the MeterLogger to sample gas combustion in the stoves using IR between the dongle and the Testo Gas Probe.\r\n\r\nThe meterLogger will have a great impact in the daily lives of our sub 1000 citizens!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeterLogger is:\r\n\r\nMeterlogger is composed of a dongle and an app running on a iphone.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the two is standard stereo/mic audio cable and the dongle runs leaches power through the same connection.\r\n\r\nThe dongle takes care of translation between audio and IR but the business logic is embedded in the app running on the phone.\r\n\r\nThe app takes care of checksumming if the chosen meter supports it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently supported devices/meters/sensors:\r\n\r\nTested and working:\r\n\r\nKamstrup Multical 601 \r\n\r\nKamstrup Multical 3 \r\n\r\nKamstrup Multical\r\n\r\nTesto Gas Probe 310","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
