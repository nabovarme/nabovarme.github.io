# Nabovarme
Project “Nabovarme” (meaning “neighbour heating”) has transformed private heating necessity into a social experiment build on OpenSource software/hardware and social empowerment by transforming heat consumers into Nabovarme Users and letting them take ownership to infrastructure and consumption.


Our project has unlocked a broad range of devices so data and control now is in the hands of the users - and not sent out of the community.

## Nabovarme at 34c3
Nabovarme is talking at 34th Chaos Communications Congress 34c3 2017 in Leipzig, Germany.
A Delegation consisting of Stoffer, Emmerik and Johannes went there to promote the project and Christiania and maybe
find new people that want to engage in the project.
