# Nabovarme
Project “Nabovarme” (meaning “neighbour heating”) has transformed private heating necessity into a social experiment build on OpenSource software/hardware and social empowerment by transforming heat consumers into Nabovarme Users and letting them take ownership to infrastructure and consumption.

Our project has unlocked a broad range of devices so data and control now is in the hands of the users - and not sent out of the community.
