        <p>The MeterLogger is an offline datalogger with online sync possibilities 
It uses a custom audio dongle for communication with devices. 
The concept is to make it easy to gather data from a wide range of heating/electricity/gas meters and store them on your smartphone for viewing and sharing. 
Simply plug in the dongle, choose your device from the list, make a new sample and decide further actions (save, share, sync etc) 
DETAILS
This section can be used to explain everything about your project.</p>

<p>Usecase:</p>

<p>In Christiania (freetown in Denmark) we have an off-grid heating infrastructure running with wooden pellet stoves. To send out bills we need to be able to read the meters installed at all households in a fast and easy manner.</p>

<p>Before we used pen and paper and sampled only once a year but now every household can sample their meter and report back to the central with fresh and more frequent samples.</p>

<p>We can also use the MeterLogger to sample gas combustion in the stoves using IR between the dongle and the Testo Gas Probe.</p>

<p>The meterLogger will have a great impact in the daily lives of our sub 1000 citizens!</p>

<p>MeterLogger is:</p>

<p>Meterlogger is composed of a dongle and an app running on a iphone.</p>

<p>The connection between the two is standard stereo/mic audio cable and the dongle runs leaches power through the same connection.</p>

<p>The dongle takes care of translation between audio and IR but the business logic is embedded in the app running on the phone.</p>

<p>The app takes care of checksumming if the chosen meter supports it.</p>

<p>Currently supported devices/meters/sensors:</p>
